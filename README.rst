The ``pybugrepellent`` tool is a Python version of the original Commodore 64
Bug Repellent utility printed in Ahoy! magazine in the mid-eighties.

Bug Repellent was used to check the accuracy of C64 programs typed-in from the 
magazine. Line codes were printed in the magazine after each program listing to
check against the output of Bug Repellent to quickly identify lines that had
errors.
